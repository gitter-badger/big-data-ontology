# big-data-ontology
Ontology for technological solutions in the domain of Big Data.

# Goal
The general intention is to create an interactive tool, which will allow users to search, explore, and select technologies from the zoo of different big data projects.

# Principles
1. Simplicity
  * Data is stored in simple text-based ontology written in DSL, which can be supported by a community. Text form is important for versioning. Text in DSL is readable and writable.
2. Each piece of information is proved by a link on documentation or to an reviewed article.

# Architecture
* Data is stored in simple text-based ontology written in DSL, which can be supported by a community. Text form is important for versioning.
* Translator from DSL into json (RDF...)
* d3.js based interactive component for a browser
* Reasoner
